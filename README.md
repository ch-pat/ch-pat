Hello, I'm Patryk from Italy.

I have a passion for videogames and the magic of algebra.

I'm currently working full-time for NTTData as a software developer while also studying for my master's degree in computer science, which mainly includes topics about machine learning, AI and data science.

My github contains some of my university projects and a couple personal projects, some I worked on more, some less.

You can check my gh-page for more info: [https://ch-pat.github.io/](https://ch-pat.github.io/)
